Self-Evaluation

This has been a surprisingly challenging subject for me. There were ups and downs over the course of the semester while doing this module, but I am pleased to say the I have learned a lot about web development, especially server-side programming with php.

I shall start with my accomplishments. 
•	I learned about server-side programming with php
•	I learned how to build web applications using MySQL databases.
•	Honed my front-end development skills with HTML and CSS.

There were some areas with which I struggled.
•	I underestimated how long certain tasks would take to achieve. This has haunted my many times in my life.
•	Sometimes, I struggled to fully understand what was required of me. I shall have to work harder in the future to improve in this area.


On the balance of things, I would say I slightly under-achieved. I know I am capable of better. However, I will take this as a learning experience and work harder in my future academic and professional careers.
